## The Rundown
Hypertext <u>Markup</u> Language
- This isn't a programming language

Describes the structure of a webpage
- Uses tags to declare elements
- _Usually,_ pairs of tags (open and close)
    - Example: 
	```
	<div> content </div>
	```
	- This makes a div element with some content inside
		- Info for what a div is later

## The Boilerplate
```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- Imports/ styles/ code /metadata here -->
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Webpage stuff here -->
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

The code you see above is something you will see in most wepbages
- I can't say all since there are multiple ways to make a website, and some of them use different syntax, some of them don't even use code *Cough* Wix *Cough*
- This code sections our webpage into 2 main sections:
	- The head
		- This is where we will add metadata needed by the webpage
		- Title of the webpage
		- Imports (CSS, JS, frameworks, etc.)
	- The body
		- Contains the actual components of the webpage
		- What the user will see when they open the page
